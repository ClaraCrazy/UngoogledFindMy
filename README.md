### Auto enabling location

The app is able to automatically enable location if it is off, but you need to grant a specific permission through adb.

To grant the permission you need to do the following:
1. Install [LADB](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.draco.ladb)
2. In the Android Developer Options enable Wireless debugging (Device Settings > Developer Options > Wireless Debugging)
3. Connect LADB to your phone (You might have to use split-screen with both apps, since the settings app will minimize the OTP window otherwise):
   * Click the Wireless Debugging option, this will bring Wireless Debugging Configuration
   * Click Pair Device with pairing code, this will show a wifi Pairing Code with device ip & port to be used in LADB to pair
5. Let LADB connect, wait for it to say "Success" and then run the following command:

```
adb shell pm grant com.claracrazy.ungoogledfindmy android.permission.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS
```


## Security
### Security measures in place

This application manages sensitive data. As such, it strives to be as secure as possible. There are two walls to resist a potential malicious individual:
* Password (mandatory): The default password is ```systemctl```. Change it to something more secure to enhance your protection. Furthermore, you probably know that SMS are not encrypted. This means that it is advised to change your password when you send to your smartphone messages containing it in order to deny access to attackers as soon as possible (unlikely and costly attack, yet let's try to prevent any displeasing scenario).
* Whitelist (optional): Whitelist numbers are the only numbers that the app will accept communications from.

### Legit apks
GitHub's releases section is the only place where I am uploading apks. 

### Antivirus' false positives
Some antivirus falsely report it's a malware due to the app's extensive demanding permissions.

## More info
There is already Google Find My Device, but I wanted a free and open source alternative (even tho it is suggested to keep Google's, unless you do not have Play Services and/or wanting to go full-in about privacy). There is already a good FOSS alternative, [Find My Device](https://gitlab.com/Nulide/findmydevice) (from which I took inspiration from), but wanted to change it a little. Xfarrow did [fork](https://www.github.com/xfarrow/FindMyDevice) it, and eventually they decided to create [their own project](https://github.com/xfarrow/locatemydevice), which in turn lead to this fork.

<p>Since I work full-time on open-source projects spread across my organizations, my only source of income is donations from people like you that use & appreciate my stuff. So, if you can spare a dollar or two, I would really appreciate that. All the money goes towards paying rent, essentials like food, drinks etc, and most importantly it will be used to fuel my cookie addictionüç™<br></p>
